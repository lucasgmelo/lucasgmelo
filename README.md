- 🔭  I’m currently working on <b>#100DaysOfCode</b>. Checkout my repo or ask me anything!
- 🌱  I’m currently learning <b>Javascript, React JS and Swift!</b>
- 💬  I really love creating connections. <i>Let's talk!</i>
- 🤍  Fun fact: I'm also photographer. I love all forms of art and that's why I love coding: <b>it's art for me</b>. Programming also allows me to create and change other people's lives <b>through how I see the world</b>. And that's why I wanna keep learning a bit more everyday: I want to create a better world.
